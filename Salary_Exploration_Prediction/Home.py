Here are some things to keep in mind:

- The salary prediction is based on historical data and might not capture real-time changes in the job market.
- Data visualization is a powerful tool to understand complex data, but it's equally important to interpret these visualizations within the appropriate context.
- We encourage users to explore various filters and options to best understand the changes of the tech industry's salary landscape.
